This code intiates Trie by calling Trie() and create word tier by calling trie.insert(word). And also it can look up prefix and return suffix candidate after prefix. Time_complexity is O(n) in the worst case. (ex. Trie has only one path or Trie has a lot of only first path.) 
Space_complexity is O(n) because every item store one location.
