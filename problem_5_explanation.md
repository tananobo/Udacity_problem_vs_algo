This code intiates Trie by calling Trie() and create word tier by calling trie.insert(word). And also it can look up prefix and return suffix candidate after prefix. <br>

Algorithm methodology: One kind of search tree <br>
Time complexity: O(n) / the worst case. (ex. Trie has only one path or Trie has a lot of only first path.)  <br>
Space complexity: O(n) / Because every item store one location. <br>
