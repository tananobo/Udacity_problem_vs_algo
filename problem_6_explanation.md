This code looks for smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers. 

Algorithm methodology: simple traversing
Time complexity: O(n) / it can find the max and min in a single traversal.
Space complexity: O(n) / need to keep the memory size for list of unsorted integers (size = n), maximun number (size = 1) and minimum number (size = 1)
