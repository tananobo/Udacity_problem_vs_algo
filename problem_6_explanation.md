This code looks for smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers. <br>

Algorithm methodology: simple traversing <br> 
Time complexity: O(n) / it can find the max and min in a single traversal. <br>
Space complexity: O(n) / need to keep the memory size for list of unsorted integers (size = n), maximun number (size = 1) and minimum number (size = 1)
