This code looks for smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers. <br>

Algorithm methodology: simple traversing <br> 
Time complexity: O(n) / it can find the max and min in a single traversal. <br>
Space complexity: O(n) for storing the input integer list (length = n), O(1) for auxiliary space: both storing maximun number (size = 1) and minimum number (size = 1)
