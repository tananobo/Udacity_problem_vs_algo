This cord sorts 0,1,2 numbers in list in order. <br>

Algorithm methodology: Just sorting from front to end and from end to front <br>
Time complexity: O(n) / Because traverse both "0" from front to end and "2" from end to front one time. <br>
Space complexity: O(1) for auxiliary space: storing variables loc0 (size = 1), loc2 (size = 1) and current (size = 1)
