This cord sorts 0,1,2 numbers in list in order. 

Algorithm methodology: Just sorting from front to end and from end to front
Time complexity: O(n) / Because traverse both "0" from front to end and "2" from end to front one time.
Space complexity: O(n) / because only use original list (length n) iteself.
