This code intiates RouterTrie by calling Router() and add handler by calling Router.add_handler(path_name, handler_name). And also it can look up handler from path_mane. Time_complexity is O(n) in the worst case. (ex. Trie has only one path or Trie has a lot of only first path.) 
Space_complexity is O(n) because every item store just one location.
